  //
  //      Every payload file MUST be listed in every payload manifest
  //
  // and ยง 2.2.1 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8493#section-2.2.1):
  //
  //      Each tag manifest MUST NOT list any tag manifests but SHOULD list the
  //      remaining tag files present in the bag.
  //
  // This should already have been checked by the BagReader before creating
  // an instance of this class, so we can display useful errors to users.
  // This assertion is meant to prevent against programmer error in the
  // storage service code, not malformed bags uploaded by users.
