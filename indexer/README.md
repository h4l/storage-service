# indexer

We want to use the storage service to do bulk analysis of our files.
For example, we might ask questions like:

*   How many images did we digitise last month?
*   What file formats are we holding?
*   How big are the files we're storing?

The indexer apps record manifests, files and ingests in Elasticsearch.
